# Design and philosophy

## The problem

Evaluating models costs real time and money, and the output is usually a pair of
numbers:

```
Model A: 84.7
Model B: 86.2
```

From which teams conclude: ship B. But that conclusion rests on assumptions the
numbers don't show. The difference might not be statistically significant. The
sample might be too small. A second judge might disagree. The benchmark might be
saturated, so a gain near the ceiling means little. The improvement might vanish
when the prompt wording changes.

Most evaluation tools report *what* the score is. Very few tell you whether you
should *believe* it.

## The idea

EvalTrust is an **evaluation auditor**, not another eval framework, benchmark, or
judge. The analogy is financial accounting: companies keep their own books, and
audits exist because bookkeeping answers "what are the numbers?" while an audit
answers "can you trust these numbers?" EvalTrust plays the second role for
evaluations.

It runs *after* your existing eval tool rather than replacing it, which makes it
easy to adopt: you keep your current workflow and add one command at the end.

Every feature answers exactly one question:

> Is the evidence from this evaluation strong enough to justify the decision I'm
> about to make?

## Pillars of trust

A trustworthy evaluation is repeatable, statistically sound, robust, and
consistent across evaluators, on a healthy benchmark. EvalTrust's checks map onto
these pillars. The first release audits four of them from the data already in your
results file:

- **Statistical Validity** — is the gap real, large enough to matter, and was the
  sample big enough to detect it?
- **Benchmark Health** — can the benchmark separate these models at all?
- **Repeatability** — would a rerun reach the same conclusion?
- **Judge Reliability** — would a different judge reach the same verdict?

Two further pillars — robustness to perturbation, and reproducibility provenance —
require generating new evidence (re-running the eval, calling additional judges)
rather than analyzing an existing file, and are planned as opt-in features.

## Principles

**Sit after the eval, not in place of it.** EvalTrust reads what your tool already
produced. Adoption costs one command.

**No arbitrary score.** The output is a plain-language verdict — High, Moderate,
or Low Confidence — backed by specific findings. A single opaque number would just
recreate the problem EvalTrust exists to solve.

**Every finding is actionable.** Each one answers three questions: why it matters,
how we detected it, and how to fix it. A warning you can't act on is noise.

**Missing evidence is a recommendation.** When a check needs data the file doesn't
contain, EvalTrust doesn't guess or crash — it explains how to generate that
evidence. "Add repeated runs" is itself useful advice.

**The auditor is held to its own standard.** Every statistical method is validated
against an independent reference implementation, and all resampling is seeded, so
the audit is reproducible. A tool that demands reproducibility has to be
reproducible itself.

## Scope of the first release

Deliberately small and correct rather than broad and shaky:

- Offline command-line tool, no API keys, no configuration.
- Reads Promptfoo, nested JSON, record lists, and CSV; pairs two single-model
  files for tools like DeepEval.
- The four pillars above, computed from the results file.
- Terminal report.

Out of scope for now: HTML reports, a Python API, framework plugins, dashboards,
and any feature that calls models or orchestrates new evaluation runs. Each is a
later step with its own design.
