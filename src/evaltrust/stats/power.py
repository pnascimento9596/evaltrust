This is what turns "the difference wasn't significant" into an actionable
recommendation. Either the effect is genuinely absent, or the sample was too
small to see it — power analysis distinguishes the two and tells the user how
many more examples would be needed.

Uses the exact noncentral-t formulation (matching statsmodels), not a normal
approximation.
