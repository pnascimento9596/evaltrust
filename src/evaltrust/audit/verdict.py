"""The overall confidence verdict.

Deliberately *not* a weighted mystery score. The rule is simple and auditable:

  - Any FAIL  -> LOW      (a load-bearing part of the conclusion is unsupported)
  - Any WARN  -> MODERATE (the conclusion holds but with real caveats)
  - All PASS  -> HIGH     (the evidence backs the conclusion)

SKIP findings are evidence you don't have; they never raise confidence. If there
is no usable evidence at all, confidence is LOW by definition.
