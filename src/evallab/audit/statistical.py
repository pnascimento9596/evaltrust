"""Statistical Validity audit.

The question: is the reported gap between two models real evidence, or noise?
Four complementary views, each a separate finding so nothing hides:

  1. Significance     - a paired permutation test: could this gap arise by chance?
  2. Confidence CI    - a paired bootstrap CI on the gap: does it exclude zero?
  3. Effect size      - Cohen's d: is the gap big enough to matter, not just real?
  4. Power            - was the sample large enough to have detected this gap?

Together they stop the two classic mistakes: shipping on noise (a lucky gap) and
shipping on a real-but-trivial gap that won't survive contact with production.
