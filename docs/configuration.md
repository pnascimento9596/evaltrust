# Configuration

EvalTrust ships with sensible defaults, but a team can set its own statistical
policy once and have it applied everywhere the audit runs — locally, in CI, and
in the Python API.

## Where config comes from

In order of precedence (highest first):

1. **Command-line flags** — e.g. `--alpha`, `--equivalence-margin`, `--seed`.
2. **An explicit file** — `evaltrust audit results.json --config policy.toml`.
3. **`.evaltrust.toml`** in the current directory.
4. **`[tool.evaltrust]`** in `pyproject.toml`.
5. **Built-in defaults**.

## Example `.evaltrust.toml`

Drop this in your repo and every audit uses it:

```toml
alpha = 0.01                     # stricter significance than the 0.05 default
equivalence_margin = 0.02        # what counts as "no real difference", in score units
judge_agreement_threshold = 0.9  # require 90% inter-judge agreement to pass
```

Or the same under `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.evaltrust]
alpha = 0.01
saturation_fraction = 0.9
```

## All settings

| Key | Default | What it controls |
|-----|---------|------------------|
| `alpha` | `0.05` | Significance level. |
| `equivalence_margin` | `0.05` | Largest score gap treated as practically negligible (for equivalence). |
| `power_target` | `0.8` | Target power for the sample-size / minimum-detectable-effect advice. |
| `smallest_meaningful_effect` | `0.2` | Cohen's d worth powering for when recommending more examples. |
| `precision_margin` | `0.05` | Target confidence-interval half-width for a single-model score. |
| `saturation_fraction` | `0.95` | Mean-over-ceiling above which a benchmark is "saturated". |
| `min_spread` | `0.01` | Pooled score std below which the benchmark can't discriminate. |
| `judge_agreement_threshold` | `0.8` | Inter-judge agreement (and judge-vs-gold) required to pass. |
| `reference_judge` | *(auto)* | Name of the human/gold judge to calibrate against (else auto-detected). |
| `n_resamples` | `10000` | Bootstrap / permutation resamples. |
| `seed` | `0` | RNG seed (reproducibility). |
| `correction` | `"bonferroni"` | Multiple-comparison correction for a multi-metric suite: `bonferroni`, `holm`, or `none`. |

## Multi-metric correction

When a file scores several metrics, testing them all at the same `alpha` inflates
false positives, so EvalTrust corrects the significance threshold for the number
of metrics. Choose the method with `correction` (or `--correction` on the CLI):

- **`bonferroni`** (default) — divide the threshold by the number of metrics
  (`alpha / k`). Simple and strict.
- **`holm`** — Holm-Bonferroni, a step-down refinement that rejects at least as
  many metrics as Bonferroni at the same family-wise error rate, so a genuine win
  is less likely to be missed. It costs a second pass over the resampling.
- **`none`** — audit each metric at the raw `alpha` with no correction.

```toml
correction = "holm"
```

Or per run: `evaltrust audit results.json --correction holm`.

## From Python

```python
from evaltrust.config import AuditConfig
from evaltrust import run_audit

cfg = AuditConfig(alpha=0.01, equivalence_margin=0.02)
report = run_audit(data, config=cfg)
```

`AuditConfig.load()` reads the same files the CLI does, if you want to honour a
repo's policy in your own scripts.
