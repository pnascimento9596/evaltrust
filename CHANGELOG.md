# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `evaltrust --version` prints the installed version and exits.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-08

### Added

- **Single-model auditing.** Point EvalTrust at one model's scores (no comparison)
  and it reports whether you can trust the number: a confidence interval on the
  score (precision), and — with `--threshold` — whether the model really clears a
  target. A single-model file now audits instead of erroring.

### Changed

- README and docs refreshed to cover the full feature set (single-model,
  multi-metric, judge calibration, config, regression `diff`, integrations).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-08

### Added

- **Multi-metric suites.** A file with a `metric` column is audited one metric at
  a time (same model pair throughout), with the significance threshold
  **Bonferroni-corrected** for the number of metrics so testing many metrics
  doesn't manufacture false wins. The suite's confidence is its weakest metric.
- `evaltrust.audit_suite(...)` Python API and `SuiteReport` (with `to_dict()`);
  the CLI auto-detects multi-metric files and renders a per-metric summary.
- **Embed it in your own eval/tests:** `report.raise_if_below(level)` raises an
  `UntrustworthyError` (an `AssertionError`) so it fails a pytest cleanly.
- **Config file:** set a team's thresholds once in `.evaltrust.toml` or
  `[tool.evaltrust]`; `AuditConfig` bundles every threshold and all are now
  configurable. CLI `--config`, plus flag overrides.
- **CI gate:** `--fail-under high|moderate|low` and a bundled GitHub Action.
- **Judge calibration:** when the file has a human/gold judge, measure how well
  each AI judge agrees with it (`--reference-judge`, or auto-detected names).
- **Regression detection:** `evaltrust diff old.json new.json` flags where
  confidence dropped or a real win was lost between two runs.

### Changed

- Ingestion skips rows with missing/unreadable scores instead of crashing, and
  reports the count as a Data Quality finding. A model with no comparable scores
  now errors cleanly.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-07

### Added

- `--explain` flag to show why each flag matters and how it was measured.

### Changed

- Redesigned the report to be scannable at a glance: verdict and one line, checks
  grouped by pillar, a short "What to do" list, and optional "To check more". The
  full reasoning for each flag now lives behind `--explain`.
- Tightened all finding text to be terse and plain; `--plain` output is now
  guaranteed ASCII.
- Rewrote the README and docs to explain, plainly, what the tool does and why its
  numbers are trustworthy.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-07

### Added

- **Python API**: `evaltrust.audit(source)` accepts a path, two paths, or an
  `EvalData`; `report.to_dict()` is JSON-serializable.
- **CLI output modes**: `--json` for CI and tooling, `--plain` for ASCII-only
  output that is safe on Windows terminals, CI logs, and pipes.
- **Equivalence testing**: the statistical audit can now conclude two models are
  *statistically equivalent* within a configurable `--equivalence-margin`, instead
  of forcing every non-significant result to look like a failure.
- Proportion-appropriate statistics for pass/fail data: **McNemar's exact test**
  and **Cohen's h** / risk difference.
- **DeepEval adapter**: reads DeepEval's test-results export directly.
- Reports name the models that weren't compared when a file has more than two.

### Changed

- The Statistical Validity pillar now reports **decision / effect size /
  precision**. "Not significant" is reported as *inconclusive* or *equivalent*
  rather than a blunt failure.
- Replaced post-hoc (observed-effect) power with the prospective **minimum
  detectable effect**.
- Verdict summaries reflect the actual outcome (equivalent / inconclusive), not a
  generic "improvement is probably real".
- Documented the tool's assumptions and limitations, and made adapter-coverage
  claims precise.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-07

Initial release.

### Added

- `evaltrust audit` command: reads an evaluation results file and prints a
  High/Moderate/Low confidence verdict.
- Four audit pillars:
  - **Statistical Validity** — paired permutation test, bootstrap confidence
    interval, Cohen's *d*, and power analysis.
  - **Benchmark Health** — saturation and discrimination checks.
  - **Repeatability** — rerun stability and measurement noise (when the file
    contains repeated runs).
  - **Judge Reliability** — inter-judge consensus, agreement, and outlier
    detection (when the file contains multiple judges).
- Format auto-detection with adapters for Promptfoo, nested JSON, generic record
  lists, and CSV (long and wide).
- Two-file comparison for single-model tools (e.g. two DeepEval runs), paired by
  example id.
- `--strict` flag to fail CI on a Low-Confidence verdict.
- Deterministic, seeded resampling so audits are reproducible.
