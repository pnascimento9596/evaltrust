Teams spend real money evaluating models, then look at two numbers:

```
Model A: 84.7
Model B: 86.2   ->  ship B
```

That single comparison hides a dozen assumptions. Maybe the difference isn't
statistically significant. Maybe the sample is too small. Maybe another judge
disagrees, or the benchmark is already saturated. Most eval tools tell you *what*
your score is. **EvalTrust tells you whether you should believe it.**

It works like a financial audit: bookkeeping answers "what are the numbers?"; an
audit answers "can you trust them?" EvalTrust is the audit for evaluations. It runs
*after* your existing eval tool — it doesn't replace it.

## Example

```console
$ evaltrust audit gpt4_run.json claude_run.json
```

```

```

Two runs at 71% and 74% — a three-point "win" that is actually noise. EvalTrust
catches it before it becomes a shipping decision.

## Installation

```bash
pip install evaltrust
```

Requires Python 3.10 or newer. That's the whole setup — no API keys, no config,
no account.

<details>
<summary>Install from source (for development)</summary>

```bash
git clone https://github.com/k-dickinson/evaltrust
cd evaltrust
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest
```

</details>

## Quick start

1. Run your evaluation with whatever tool you already use (DeepEval, Promptfoo,
   LangSmith, OpenEvals, or a plain CSV) and save the output.
2. Point EvalTrust at it:

   ```bash
   # A file that already compares two or more models (e.g. Promptfoo):
   evaltrust audit results.json

   # Two single-model runs (e.g. two DeepEval runs), paired by example id:
   evaltrust audit gpt4_run.json claude_run.json
   ```

3. Read the verdict. Fix what it flags. Re-run.

Want to see it work before pointing it at your own data? The repo ships sample
files:

```bash
evaltrust audit examples/clean_win.json        # -> High Confidence
evaltrust audit examples/borderline.json       # -> Moderate Confidence
evaltrust audit examples/deepeval_gpt4.json examples/deepeval_claude.json
```

Useful flags:

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--json` | Emit the full audit as JSON, for CI logic and experiment trackers. |
| `--plain` | Plain ASCII output — safe for Windows terminals, CI logs, and piping to a file. |
| `--strict` | Exit with a non-zero status on a Low-Confidence verdict (use it to gate CI). |
| `--model-a`, `--model-b` | Choose which two models to compare, or label the two files. |
| `--alpha` | Significance level (default `0.05`). |
| `--seed` | Seed for the resampling (results are deterministic; change only to stress-test). |

## Use it from Python

The CLI is a thin wrapper over a small API, so you can audit inside a notebook,
a training script, or a CI job:

```python
import evaltrust

report = evaltrust.audit("results.json")           # path, two paths, or an EvalData
print(report.verdict.level)                         # VerdictLevel.HIGH / MODERATE / LOW

if report.verdict.level is evaltrust.VerdictLevel.LOW:
    raise SystemExit("Evaluation isn't trustworthy enough to ship on.")

report.to_dict()          # machine-readable, JSON-serializable — log it, store it, diff it
```

## Gate CI on it

`--strict` returns a non-zero exit code on a Low-Confidence verdict, so an audit
can block a merge the way failing tests do:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/eval.yml
- name: Audit the evaluation
  run: |
    pip install evaltrust
    evaltrust audit results.json --strict --plain
```

## What it checks

EvalTrust audits four pillars of trust and ends in one plain-language verdict —
**High**, **Moderate**, or **Low Confidence**. There is no arbitrary aggregate
score.

| Pillar | The question it answers |
|--------|-------------------------|
| **Statistical Validity** | Is the gap real, large enough to matter, and was the sample big enough to detect it? Paired permutation test, bootstrap confidence interval, Cohen's *d*, and power analysis. |
| **Benchmark Health** | Can the benchmark even separate these models, or is it saturated / flat? |
| **Repeatability** | If you reran the evaluation, would the winner stay the winner? Uses repeated-run data when the file contains it. |
| **Judge Reliability** | Would a different judge reach the same verdict? Uses multi-judge data when the file contains it. |

Every finding follows the same rule — **why it matters**, **how we detected it**,
and **how to fix it**. Checks that need extra data (repeated runs, multiple
judges) don't guess when it's missing; they tell you how to generate it.

See [`docs/checks.md`](docs/checks.md) for the methods and thresholds behind each
one.

## Supported inputs

You never write an EvalTrust-specific format. It reads what your tool already
produced and auto-detects the shape:

- **Promptfoo** results (several providers compared across test cases)
- **Nested JSON** — `{"models": [...], "examples": [{"id", "scores": {...}}]}`
- **Record lists** — JSON like `[{"id", "model", "score"}, ...]`
- **CSV** — long (`id,model,score`) or wide (`id,gpt,claude`)

Single-model tools (DeepEval, LangSmith, OpenEvals) evaluate one model per run,
so you pass two files and EvalTrust pairs them. Details in
[`docs/input-formats.md`](docs/input-formats.md).

## How it works

```
your eval output ──▶ auto-detect + adapter ──▶ canonical model ──▶ audit ──▶ verdict
```

Adapters map every format into one internal representation, so the statistics are
written once and work everywhere. Every statistical method is validated in the
test suite against an independent reference (`scipy` and `statsmodels`), and all
resampling is seeded, so the auditor is itself reproducible. See
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md).

## Roadmap

- **Now:** offline CLI, four pillars, terminal report.
- **Next:** dedicated adapters for more tools, a Python API (`evaltrust.audit(...)`),
  and an optional HTML report.
- **Later:** opt-in orchestration for the pillars that need to generate evidence
  (robustness perturbations, extra judges) and a provenance/reproducibility check.
