"""Pair two single-system evaluation files into one A-vs-B comparison.

Single-system tools (DeepEval, LangSmith, OpenEvals) evaluate one model per run,
so their exports contain a single model. Point EvalLab at two such files and it
pairs them by example id into the canonical two-model shape the auditor expects.
A file that already contains several models is audited directly instead — this
path is only for the one-model-per-file case.
