"""Statistical Validity audit.

The question: is the reported gap between two models real evidence you can act on?
Three findings, each a separate view so nothing hides:

  1. decision    - is there a real, meaningful improvement? The answer is one of
                   three honest outcomes, never a blunt "not significant = fail":
                     * significant  - the leader really is ahead
                     * equivalent   - the models are the same within a margin you
                                      set (a genuine conclusion, not a failure)
                     * inconclusive - not enough evidence either way (underpowered)
  2. effect_size - how big is the gap, in interpretable terms (Cohen's d, or a
                   proportion effect size for pass/fail data)
  3. precision   - was the sample large enough, framed prospectively via the
                   minimum detectable effect (not misleading post-hoc power)

For paired pass/fail data it uses McNemar's exact test and a proportion effect
size; for continuous scores, a paired permutation test and Cohen's d.
