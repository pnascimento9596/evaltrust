"""Effect size for a paired comparison.

A p-value tells you whether a difference is real; an effect size tells you
whether it is *big enough to care about*. A tiny, perfectly-measured difference
can be statistically significant yet practically meaningless — EvalTrust reports
both so nobody ships on significance alone.
