"""Audit configuration — one place for a team's statistical policy.

Every threshold the audit uses lives here with a sensible default. A team can
override them in a ``.evaltrust.toml`` (or a ``[tool.evaltrust]`` table in
``pyproject.toml``) checked into their repo, so the same policy is enforced
everywhere the audit runs.
