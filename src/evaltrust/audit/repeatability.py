"""Repeatability audit.

The question: if you ran this evaluation again tomorrow, would you reach the same
conclusion? Stochastic judges and sampling make eval scores wobble; if the winner
changes from one run to the next, the ranking is noise dressed up as a result.

Requires repeated-run data in the file. When it is absent we don't guess — we
emit a SKIP that tells the user how to generate the evidence.
