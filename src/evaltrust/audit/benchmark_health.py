"""Benchmark Health audit.

Even a flawless comparison is worthless on a broken benchmark. Two failure modes
matter most in practice:

  - Saturation: everyone already scores near the ceiling, so there is no room
    left to demonstrate an improvement.
  - No discrimination: the benchmark gives essentially the same score to
    everything, so it cannot separate any two models regardless of the stats.
